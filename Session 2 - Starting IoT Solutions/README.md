# Session 2 - Starting IoT Solutions #

The slide deck contains the main presentation and refers to various demos.

You'll find the demo scripts in their respective folders so you can rehearse the demos.  Be sure to checkout the setup requirements in each of the demos at least one day before your presentation.  You may have 30-60 minutes of setup to do.

Be sure to pay attention to the Teardown instructions to make sure you do not receive excessive Azure service charges.

NOTE: Demo 2.4 is optional, requiring the use of a physical Raspberry PI device with Raspian and suitable keyboard + trackpad/mouse, video adapters and a network connection.  You will not find a video of this demo in the T3 materials.
